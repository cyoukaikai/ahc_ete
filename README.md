# AHC_ETE

This repository includes the code used for the paper "From Certain to Uncertain: Toward Optimal Solution for Offline Multiple Object Tracking" (ICPR 2020).
The work was done when I am working at Smart Mobility Reseach Center (SMRC) of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology.


### Installation

```
conda create -n ahc-ete python=3.7
conda activate ahc-ete

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

We modified the ``

cd scikit-learn
pip install -e ./
cd ../

```
